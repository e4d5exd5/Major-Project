What do we have?

We have:

Original Data: X : (width, height, pca_components)
Original Data: Y : (width, height, )

Patches: X : (width * height, windowSize, windowSize, pca_components)
Patches: Y : (width * height, )

Model which takes in (BatchSize, windowSize, windowSize, pca_components, channels) and outputs (BatchSize, 128)

---
If you notice, we are not pass a single pixel we are passing a window of pixels. This is because we want to capture the spatial information of the pixels.
But while classifying we are classifying the whole window and not the center pixel. But while checking if the prediction and class of center pixel.
---
Hence, if except for the center pixel, all other pixels are classified correctly, we will still get a low accuracy.

====
Ignoring this, let's try to classify each pixel in the whole image.
We will use a sliding window approach to classify each pixel in the image.

Remember we have the Patch X 's 1st dimentions as width * height.
Now let's reshape it to (width, height, windowSize, windowSize, pca_components)
